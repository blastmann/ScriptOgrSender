## ScriptOgrSender for ST2

This is just a simple plug-in for Sublime Text 2. In order to post our markdown posts to our blog easily, we just don't want to leave ST2 and just submit the post directly.

### 2013-02-04 Update
Release version 0.2.1. **TEST IS NOT DONE YET!**

#### Changelog
* Refactor the command classes
* UTF8 data encode
* A new Snippet for ScriptOgr.am article headers
* Add shortcuts scope (Shortcuts will only activate in Markdown format document)

### Remember: I didn't add my app key into this plugin. Without app key, the api will not work. I still can't find the way to encrypt my key in the source code. When I find that, I will update the plugin soon.
