## ScriptOgrSender for ST2

This is just a simple plug-in for Sublime Text 2. In order to post our markdown posts to our blog easily, we just don't want to leave ST2 and just submit the post directly.

### 2013-02-02 Update
Release version 0.1, basically support the ScriptOgr.am api.

### Remember: I didn't add my app key into this plugin. Without app key, the api will not work. I still can't find the way to encrypt my key in the source code. When I find that, I will update the plugin soon.

### Manual
